         <p><pre><b><u>Weakness :</u> </b></pre></p>
         <p><blockquote><i><b>Overcommitting:</b> Given their enthusiasm for exploring passions and engaging in various activities, there's a risk of overcommitting and spreading themselves too thin. This could lead to burnout or reduced quality in their endeavors.</i></blockquote></p>
         <p><blockquote><i><b>Difficulty Saying <strikethrough>No</strikethrough>:</b> Their openness to new experiences might make it challenging for them to say no when necessary. This could lead to taking on too many responsibilities or agreeing to things that don't align with their priorities.</i></blockquote></p>
         <p><blockquote><i><b>Lack of Focus:</b> With a wide range of interests and passions, they might struggle with maintaining focus on a single project or goal. This could result in unfinished projects or missed opportunities for deeper expertise.</i></blockquote></p>
